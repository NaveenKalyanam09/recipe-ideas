#  Recipe Ideas App

A simple React application where users can search for recipes by *dish name* or *ingredient*.  
The app fetches data from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) and displays recipe results in a clean and responsive UI.  
Clicking a recipe card opens a modal with *ingredients, instructions, and a YouTube tutorial (if available).*
